    "Our project is to use CSVs and Python to determine the \"best neighboorhood\" with a metric of our choosing. We decided to determine the best neighborhood by determining which neighborhood is the most \"green\", since its good for the residents' happiness and futures. \n",
    "We used four different data sets, each of which corresponds to a factor that makes a city/neighborhood more environmentally friendly. Each of these factors is essentially a count of something green in a neighborhood. Although we could calculate it by a simple count of each, our group feels that certain factors are more important than others, due to being more rare and/or more impactful on the environment. Therefore, some of them are weighted more than others."

It is my personal favorite neighborhood, not because of how green it is, but because of the food/shopping options, the walkability, and the buildings. It makes sense that East Liberty is a green neighborhood and I guess subconciously it boosts my mental image of it, but that's not why it was my favorite neighborhood."

After looking at the clustering, it was cool to see just how much more 'green' East Liberty was compared to the other neighborhoods. I usually go to East Liberty for Target, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes, and not much else, but in hindsight, it makes sense that East Liberty is the greenest, especially because of how walkable it is. I think it's interesting to see how the data can show us things that we might not have known before."
